# READMEGen

  # Description:

  The good readMe generator creates a readme.md file for a user working on a project. When a user clones this repo they must cd into the project folder. Once in the correct directory in the terminal, the user must then, using node, type the main file name, in this case the index file. (ex: node index.js). The user is them prompted with 9 questions, one of which is multiple choice question. All of the users input is then displayed in a generated ReadMe.md file separated into sections for easier readability. This also includes a table of contents for a quicker way to find certain sections of the file.
